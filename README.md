# About

PocketPals is a web application which allows you to train a virtual pet by playing a game. You can feed your pet and play with it to keep it happy. If you neglect your pet, it will become unhappy and eventually die.

You can also search for pets that are up for adoption near you and make a contact with the shelter to adopt them right from the application.
